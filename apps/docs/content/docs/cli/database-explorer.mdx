The database explorer is a powerful tool that provides visibility into your Better-Auth connected database.
It features an intuitive schema visualizer that helps you understand table relationships and
track which fields originate from specific plugins, making database management and troubleshooting more efficient.

## FAQ

### Does it work for all databases?

The database explorer works for any database that is supported by Better-Auth. If your DB adapter works for Better-Auth, the database explorer will work.

### How does it work?

The database explorer works by reading your better-auth configurations, and appends a custom plugin, as well as special configurations
to your auth instance. It then uses an express server hosting that auth instance with CORS rules specific to authorizing `https://better-auth-kit.com` to 
fetch the data.

### Why doesn't it have every table or field in my database?

We only know what tables and fields are available in your database by utilizing Better-Auth's schema system based on your auth instance.
This means that if you have any custom tables or fields, the database explorer will not be able to show them, unless specified in the auth config.

### Why does it say that my table row count is only 100?

It's possible that it's a limitation of your database adapter. Some databases may not have support for counting rows, which can be the cause of this.
If you believe that this is not the case, please open an issue where the database adapter comes from.
