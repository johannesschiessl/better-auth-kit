Welcome to the documentation for Better Auth Kit! ðŸ‘€

## What is Better-Auth-Kit?

Better-Auth-Kit is a collection of useful plugins, adapters, tools and examples all open source for the community to freely use on top of [Better Auth](https://github.com/better-auth/better-auth).
The project is maintained by <GithubUser>ping-maxwell</GithubUser>, a core contributor to Better Auth, however it is not officially affiliated with Better Auth.

## What is Better Auth?

Better Auth is the most comprehensive authentication library for TypeScript. You can learn more about it [here](https://github.com/better-auth/better-auth).

## Why make Better Auth Kit?

As a core contributor to Better Auth, I have been working on improving the library and adding new features.
However there are some plugins, packages or other things that are not suitable for the main Better Auth library.

I decided to create a separate library to house these plugins, adapters, tools, examples and others. Hence the creation of Better Auth Kit.
