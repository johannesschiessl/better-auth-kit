<Callout type="warn">
  #### This plugin is in Beta
  This plugin only supports password verification which returns a `valid` boolean, and does not support extending the current session yet.
  This will be added in a future release.
</Callout>

If a user's session is not fresh, critical actions (e.g. deleting their account) will not be allowed.
You would have to terminate their session, force them to sign-in again, and then be able to perform the action.
Depending on your application, this may not be the best user experience. In some cases, routes can be protected and only accessible to active sessions. By terminating a session and making them sign-in, they're redirected to the login page and may not even know what happened.

Using Reverify, you can prompt the user to re-verify their identity without logging them out or terminating their current session.

There are future plans to add more forms of authentication to reverify, such as:

- Phone number verification
- Magic link & Email OTP verification
- 2FA verification
- Passkey verification
