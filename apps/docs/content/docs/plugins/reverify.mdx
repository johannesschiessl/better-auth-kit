Sometimes you may want to re-verify the user's identity by entering a form of authentication. This can be useful for scenarios such as:

- When the user's session expires due to inactivity
- When the user requests a critical action (e.g. deleting their account)

<Steps>
  <Step>
        ### 1. Install the plugin

        ```package-install
        @better-auth-kit/reverify
        ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### 2. Initialize the plugin

    ```ts title="auth.ts"
    import { reverify } from "@better-auth-kit/reverify";

    export const auth = betterAuth({
      plugins: [reverify()],
    });
    ```

    ```ts title="auth-client.ts"
    import { reverifyClient } from "@better-auth-kit/reverify/client";

    export const authClient = createAuthClient({
      plugins: [reverifyClient()],
    });
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### 3. Use the plugin

    <Tabs items={["client", "server"]}>
      <Tab value="client">
        ```ts
        const { data } = await client.reverify.password({
          password: "some-password",
        });
        const isValid = data?.valid;
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab value="server">
        ```ts
        const data = await auth.api.reverifyPassword({
          body: {
            password: "some-password",
          },
          headers,
        });

        const isValid = data?.valid;
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>
</Steps>

There are future plans to add more forms of authentication to reverify, such as:

- Email verification
- Phone number verification
- Magic link verification
