The App Invite plugin enables you to invite users to your application through email invitations. It supports two types of invitations:

- **Personal Invitations**: Targeted to specific email addresses, ensuring only the intended recipient can use the invitation
- **Public Invitations**: Can be used by multiple users, making it ideal for open sign-up scenarios

This plugin is particularly useful for invite-only applications.

<Callout>
  This plugin was implemented as a PR for better-auth, however it is not yet merged.
  We've copied the implementation here to allow you to use it in your projects, until it is merged, in which case we will deprecate
  this plugin. And you may directly import the plugin from `better-auth` instead.

  Any issues or feedback should be directed to the active PR [here](https://github.com/better-auth/better-auth/pull/1436).

## Usage

To add members to the application, we first need to send an invitation to the user. 
The user will receive an email with the invitation link. Once the user accepts the invitation, they will be signed up to the application.

### Setup Invitation Email

For personal invites to work we first need to provide `sendInvitationEmail` to the `better-auth` instance.
This function is responsible for sending the invitation email to the user.

You'll need to construct and send the invitation link to the user. The link should include the invitation ID,
which will be used with the acceptInvitation function when the user clicks on it.

This is only required for personal invites. Sharing public invitations is up to the inviter.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { appInvite } from "@better-auth-kit/app-invite";
import { sendAppInvitation } from "./email";

export const auth = betterAuth({
  plugins: [
    appInvite({
      async sendInvitationEmail(data) {
        const inviteLink = `https://example.com/accept-invitation/${data.id}`;
        sendAppInvitation({
          name: data.name,
          email: data.email,
          invitedByUsername: data.inviter.name,
          invitedByEmail: data.inviter.email,
          inviteLink,
        });
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

### Send Invitation

To invite users to the app, you can use the `invite` function provided by the client.
the `invite` function takes an object with the following properties:

- `email`: The email address of the user to invite. Leave empty to create a public invitation.

- `resend`: A boolean value that determines whether to resend the invitation email,
if the user is already invited. Defaults to `false`

- `domainWhitelist`: An optional comma separated list of domains that allows public invitations
to be accepted only from approved domains.

```ts title="invitation.ts"
await authClient.inviteUser({
  email: "test@email.com",
});
```

### Accept Invitation

When a user receives an invitation email, they can click on the invitation link to accept the invitation.
The link should include the invitation ID, which will be used to accept the invitation.

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
await authClient.acceptInvitation({
  invitationId: "invitation-id",
  name: "John Doe", // overridden if predefined in the invitation
  email: "test@email.com", // must be set for public invites
  password: "password123456",
  // ... additional user data
});
```

### Update Invitation Status

To update the status of invitations you can use the `acceptInvitation`, `rejectInvitation`, `cancelInvitation`
function provided by the client. The functions take the invitation id as an argument.

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
// cancel invitation (by default only the inviter can cancel invitations)
await authClient.cancelInvitation({
  invitationId: "invitation-id",
});

// reject invitation (this is only available for personal invites)
await authClient.rejectInvitation({
  invitationId: "invitation-id",
});
```

### Get Invitation

To get an invitation you can use the `getAppInvitation` function provided by the client. You need to provide the
invitation id as a query parameter.

```ts title="auth-client"
await authClient.getAppInvitation({
  query: {
    id: params.id,
  },
});
```

### List Invitations

Allows an user to list all invitations issued by themself.

```ts title="auth-client"
await authClient.listInvitations({
  query: {
    limit: 10,
  },
});
```

By default 100 invitations are returned. You can adjust the limit and offset using the following query parameters:

- `searchField`: The field to search on, which can be `email`, `name` or `domainWhitelist`.
- `searchOperator`: The operator to use for the search. It can be `contains`, `starts_with`, or `ends_with`.
- `searchValue`: The value to search for.
- `limit`: The number of invitations to return.
- `offset`: The number of invitations to skip.
- `sortBy`: The field to sort the invitations by.
- `sortDirection`: The direction to sort the invitations by. Defaults to `asc`.
- `filterField`: The field to filter the invitations by.
- `filterOperator`: The operator to use for the filter. It can be `eq`, `ne`, `lt`, `lte`, `gt` or `gte`.
- `filterValue`: The value to filter the invitations by.

```ts title="Example"
await authClient.listInvitations({
  query: {
    searchField: "domainWhitelist",
    searchOperator: "contains",
    searchValue: "example.com",
    limit: 10,
    offset: 0,
    sortBy: "createdAt",
    sortDirection: "desc",
    filterField: "expiresAt",
    filterOperator: "lt",
    filterValue: new Date().toISOString(),
  },
});
```

## Schema

**allowUserToCancelInvitation**: `(data: { user: User, invitation: AppInvitation }) => Promise<boolean> | boolean` - A functon that determines whether a user can cancel inivtations. By default the user can only cancel invites created by them. You can set it to `false` to restrict users from canceling invitations.

**invitationExpiresIn**: `number` - How long the invitation link is valid for in seconds. By default, it's 48 hours (2 days).

**sendInvitationEmail**: `async (data) => Promise<void>` - A function that sends an invitation email to the user. This is only required for personal invitations.

**autoSignIn**: A boolean value that determines whether to prevent automatic sign-up when accepting an invitation. Defaults to `false`.
