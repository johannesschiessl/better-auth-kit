This plugin allow your users to upload, delete, and manage their profile pictures.
Additionally, it provides a way to store the profile picture in a storage provider of your choice, set up validation rules, and more.

<Steps>
  <Step>
        ### 1. Install the plugin

        ```package-install
        @better-auth-kit/profile-image
        ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### 2. Initialize the plugin

    Make sure you have defined `UPLOADTHING_API_KEY` in your environment variables, or define it as the `apiKey` property of the `UTApi` instance.

    ```ts title="auth.ts"
    import { profileImage, UploadThingProvider } from "@better-auth-kit/profile-image";
    import { UTApi } from "uploadthing/server";
    import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";

    const utApi = new UTApi();
    const provider = new UploadThingProvider(utApi);

    export const auth = betterAuth({ // [!code highlight]
      plugins: [profileImage({ storageProvider: provider })],// [!code highlight]
    });// [!code highlight]
    ```

    ```ts title="auth-client.ts"
    import { profileImageClient } from "@better-auth-kit/profile-image/client";
    import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client";

    export const authClient = createAuthClient({// [!code highlight]
      plugins: [profileImageClient()],// [!code highlight]
    });// [!code highlight]
    ```

## Usage

### Uploading an image

Upload an image to the user's profile.

```ts
import { authClient } from "@/lib/auth-client";

// Get a file or blob from somewhere, e.g. from a file input.
const someFileOrBlob = new File([], "image.png", { type: "image/png" });

const { data, error } = await authClient.profileImage.upload({ // [!code highlight]
  image: someFileOrBlob, // [!code highlight]
}); // [!code highlight]

if(data){
  console.log(`Successfully uploaded image to ${data.url}`);
}else{
  console.error(`Something went wrong:`, error);
}
```


<Callout>
The profile image upload functionality is currently only supported through the auth-client.
Server-side auth instance support is still in development and testing.
</Callout>

#### Upload a compressed image

By uploading a compressed image, you can reduce the size of the image by lowering the quality of the image, and converting it to JPEG
before it is uploaded to the server.

If you're using a set of cusom `allowedTypes` in the plugin options, you should ensure to include `image/jpeg` in the list.
This is because the `compressImage` function will convert the image to JPEG.


```ts
import { compressImage } from "@better-auth-kit/profile-image/client";

// Get a file or blob from somewhere, e.g. from a file input.
const someFileOrBlob = new File([], "image.png", { type: "image/png" });

const compressedImage = await compressImage(someFileOrBlob, 0.7);// [!code highlight]
if(!compressedImage) return;

const { data, error } = await authClient.profileImage.upload({
  image: compressedImage,
});
```

<Callout type="warn">
  This only works on the browser, since it requires the `createImageBitmap` API.
</Callout>


### Deleting an image

Delete the user's profile image.

<Tabs items={["client", "server"]}>
  <Tab value="client">
    ```ts
    import { authClient } from "@/lib/auth-client";

    const { error } = await authClient.profileImage.delete();
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="server">
    ```ts
    import { auth } from "@/lib/auth";

    await auth.api.deleteProfileImage({ headers: await headers() });
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
## Plugin Options

```ts
import { profileImage } from "@better-auth-kit/profile-image";

export const auth = betterAuth({
  plugins: [
    profileImage({
      // A storage provider adapter, see the storage providers section below.
      storageProvider: provider, 
       // Maximum file size in bytes, default is 5MB
      maxSize: 5 * 1024 * 1024,
      // Allowed file types, default is ["image/jpeg", "image/png", "image/webp"]
      allowedTypes: ["image/jpeg", "image/webp"], 
      canUploadImage: (session) => {
        // A function that returns a boolean, default is `true`.
        return session.user.id === "123"; 
      },
      onImageUploaded: ({ profileImage, user }) => {
        // A function that is called when the image is uploaded, default is `undefined`.
      },
      // Optional array of trusted image origins, default is undefined. If undefined, any origin is trusted.
      trustedImageOrigins: ["https://example.com"],
    }),
  ],
});
```

## Security

Any attempts at modifying or creating a user's `image` will run through validation checks to ensure they're a valid URL,
and are part of the `trustedImageOrigins` if enabled in the plugin config.

We recommend to set up a trusted image origins, to prevent users from having any way of
setting their profile picture to an image from an untrusted origin.

```ts
export const auth = betterAuth({
  plugins: [
    profileImage({
      trustedImageOrigins: ["https://example.com"],
    }),
  ],
});
```

<Callout type="warn">
  If you're using the UploadThing provider, we recommend adding `https://<YOUR_APP_ID>.ufs.sh` to the trusted image origins.
</Callout>


## Optimizations

To optimize the performance of an image upload, you have several options:

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="Compress the image on the client side">
    You can compress the image on the client side using the `compressImage` function.
    This will reduce the size of the image by lowering the quality of the image, and converting it to JPEG
     before it is uploaded to the server.

    <Callout type="warn">
    If you're using a set of cusom `allowedTypes` in the plugin options, you should ensure to include `image/jpeg` in the list.
    This is because the `compressImage` function will convert the image to JPEG.
    </Callout>
    
    ```ts
    import { compressImage } from "@better-auth-kit/profile-image/client";
    ```

    ```ts
    // 0.7 is the default quality.
    const compressedImage = await compressImage(imageBlob, 0.7); 

    // `null` is returned if the image could not be created for any reason.
    if(!compressedImage) return; 

    // Upload the compressed image to the server.
    const { data, error } = await authClient.profileImage.upload(compressedImage);
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Enforce a maximum file size">
      You can enforce a maximum file size in the plugin options, but also add checks on the client side to ensure the
      image is not too large before uploading.

      ```tsx
      const handleFileChange = async (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
        const file = e.target.files?.[0];
        if (!file) return;
        if(file.size > 1000000) { // 1MB
          // Display an error message to the user.
        }
      };
      ```

      Here's how you can enforce a maximum file size in the plugin options, like so:

      ```ts
      import { profileImage } from "@better-auth-kit/profile-image";

      export const auth = betterAuth({
        plugins: [
          profileImage({
            maxSize: 1000000, // 1MB, default is 5MB
          }),
        ],
      });
      ```
    </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Enforce specific file types">
    By forcing the user to only upload JPEG, or WebP images, you can reduce the image size versus uploading PNGs.

    You can run checks on the client side to ensure the image is of the correct type before uploading, like so:

    ```tsx
    const handleFileChange = async (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
      const file = e.target.files?.[0];
      if (!file) return;
      if(!file.type.includes("image")) {
        // Display an error message to the user.
      }
    };
    ```

    And ensure to enable the `allowedTypes` option in the plugin options, like so:

    ```ts
    import { profileImage } from "@better-auth-kit/profile-image";

    export const auth = betterAuth({
      plugins: [
        profileImage({
          allowedTypes: ["image/jpeg", "image/webp"],
        }),
      ],
    });
    ```
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Storage Providers

Right now, we only support [UploadThing](https://uploadthing.com), however we plan to support more storage providers in the future.


We hope to add these storage providers in the future:

- [Cloudflare R2](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/)
- [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)
- [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage)
- [Azure Blob Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/storage/blobs)
- [Cloud Storage for Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage)

Feel free to help us by contributing any of these storage providers,
we greatly appriciate any effort towards improving the Better Auth ecosystem!


## Future plans
We're actively working on expanding the plugin's capabilities, including features like profile picture history 
and integration with additional [storage providers](#storage-providers).
Your feedback and contributions are invaluable to us -
if you have suggestions or would like to help implement new features, we'd love to hear from you through issues or pull requests.
