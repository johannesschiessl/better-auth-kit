## What does it do?

By utilizing the `legalConsent` plugin, you can require the following legal consents on your sign-up routes:

- Terms of Service
- Privacy Policy
- Age Verification
- Marketing Consent
- Cookie Consent

Whenever a user signs up, the plugin requires you to pass additional data to the `signup` method.
The data can vary depending on the legal consent requirements you have set.
For example, if you require the user to accept the terms of service, you must pass `tosAccepted: true` to the `signup` method.
After the plugin has verified the given data is all valid, it will pass those legal consent values to the user data that will be created.

## Options

### Legal Compliance Configuration

You can enable the following legal compliance options:

```ts
legalConsent({
  tosAccepted: true,
  privacyPolicyAccepted: true,
  ageVerified: true,
  marketingConsentAccepted: true,
  cookieConsentAccepted: true
});
```

### Configuring the schema

You can configure the name of these fields by passing the `schema` option to the plugin.

```ts
legalConsent({
  schema: {
    userModelName: "user",
    tosAccepted: "tosAccepted",
    privacyPolicyAccepted: "privacyPolicyAccepted",
    ageVerified: "ageVerified",
    marketingConsentAccepted: "marketingConsentAccepted",
    cookieConsentAccepted: "cookieConsentAccepted",
  },
});
```


## Schema

Table: `user`


<Callout type="warn">
Note: Not all keys will be in the table as it depends on if you enabled each compliance, as well as if you changed the name of a given schema field.
