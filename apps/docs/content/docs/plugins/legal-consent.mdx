In some cases, you may need to require your users to accept certain compliances before they can sign up.
The purpose of this plugin is to provide a way to keep record, or evidence, of the user's consent to the compliances.

Supported compliances include: **Terms of Service**, **Privacy Policy**, 
**Age Verification**, **Marketing Consent**, and **Cookie Consent**.

Currently, we provide the most basic form of record keeping, which is a boolean field in the user model indicating 
if the user has accepted the compliance. In the future, we plan to expend this by providing the option to enable more detailed
record keeping, such as timestamps, IP addresses, device information, and more, saved in a separate table.
This makes to be better evidence of the user's consent to the compliances.

Add the following methods to your sign up page.

<Tabs items={["server", "client"]}>

<Tab value="server">
```ts
auth.api.signUpEmail({
 body: {
   email: "some_email@example.com",
    password: "some_password",
    tosAccepted: true,
    privacyPolicyAccepted: true,
    ageVerified: true,
    marketingConsentAccepted: true,
    cookieConsentAccepted: true,
 }
});
```
</Tab>

<Tab value="client">
```ts
authClient.signUp.email({
  email: "some_email@example.com",
  password: "some_password",
  tosAccepted: true,
  privacyPolicyAccepted: true,
  ageVerified: true,
  marketingConsentAccepted: true,
  cookieConsentAccepted: true,
});
```
</Tab>

</Tabs>

<Callout type="warn">
    The types may not appear in your IDE for the signUp method, this is a limitation of Better Auth. 
    Once you enable a given legal consent, you should be fine to pass that value into the sign up method and safely ignore the type error.

    Note: You do not need to pass all the legal consent values, only the ones you enabled.

## What does it do?

By utilizing the `legalConsent` plugin, you can require the following legal consents on your sign-up routes:

- Terms of Service
- Privacy Policy
- Age Verification
- Marketing Consent
- Cookie Consent

Whenever a user signs up, the plugin requires you to pass additional data to the `signup` method.
The data can vary depending on the legal consent requirements you have set.
For example, if you require the user to accept the terms of service, you must pass `tosAccepted: true` to the `signup` method.
After the plugin has verified the given data is all valid, it will pass those legal consent values to the user data that will be created.
</Comprehensive>

## Options

### Legal Compliance Configuration

You can enable the following legal compliance options:

```ts
legalConsent({
  tosAccepted: true,
  privacyPolicyAccepted: true,
  ageVerified: true,
  marketingConsentAccepted: true,
  cookieConsentAccepted: true
});
```

### Configuring the schema

You can configure the name of these fields by passing the `schema` option to the plugin.

```ts
legalConsent({
  schema: {
    userModelName: "user",
    tosAccepted: "tosAccepted",
    privacyPolicyAccepted: "privacyPolicyAccepted",
    ageVerified: "ageVerified",
    marketingConsentAccepted: "marketingConsentAccepted",
    cookieConsentAccepted: "cookieConsentAccepted",
  },
});
```


## Schema

Table: `user`


<Callout type="warn">
Note: Not all keys will be in the table as it depends on if you enabled each compliance, as well as if you changed the name of a given schema field.

<DatabaseTable
  fields={[
    {
      name: "tosAccepted",
      type: "boolean",
