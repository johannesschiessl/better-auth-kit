title: Better-Auth-Kit UI
description: UI components for the most comprehensive authentication library for TypeScript.

Given that Better-Auth works around a plugin eco-system, it's important to have a way to extend UI and extend the components that build them.

The `@better-auth-kit/ui` package is a registry utilizing the [ShadCN registry model](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/registry) to provide a way to extend your UI.

We intend to provide a large set of UI components that builds off ShadCn components, and provides a way to extend them for your auth components. For example, with our [legal-consent](/plugins/legal-consent) plugin, we provide a component that allows you to collect user consent which you can then easily plug into our provided sign-up component.

## Components

To view and install the components, you can visit the [Better-Auth-Kit Components builder](https://better-auth-kit.com/components) page.
